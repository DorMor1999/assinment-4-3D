# Computer Graphics - Homework 4 Submission

## Project Overview
This project involves designing a house based on user-defined parameters including the number of floors, number of windows on one side, and the roof color. The application features an interactive interface where users can adjust these parameters using scroll controls and see the resulting house rendered in real-time.

## Features
- **Number of Floors:** Users can set the number of floors (1-4).
- **Number of Windows:** Users can specify the number of windows on one side (1-4).
- **Roof Colors:** Users can select from three different roof colors.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** The colors, including the building color, change from face to face to reflect realistic lighting effects.

## Instructions for Running the Program
1. **Interface Overview:**
   - The right side of the window contains three scroll controls for setting the roof colors, number of floors, and number of windows.
   - The center of the window displays the rendered building.

2. **Setting Parameters:**
   - Use the scroll controls to adjust the roof colors, number of floors (1-4), and number of windows (1-4).
   - The building in the center will update in real-time to reflect the changes.

## Example Outputs
Below are example outputs of the program showcasing different configurations of the house.
